Known bugs
Cant cd without doing ls first. We need to just abstract the ls code a bit more.
And then intergrate that with cd. At the moment cd only checks if the directory
exists and doesn't do much else.
I (Justin) will be doing this on Saturday. I've been fried brain wise but I know
how we can approach the fix.

Commands done 
fsinfo 
ls
cd
