directory contains clusters and clusters contains records

file allocation table - implements linked list. Starting with a cluster and want to
get to next cluster. To get to the next one take current cluster, index into file allocation table
it will give you the next cluster number. Checking if their is or isnt a next cluster or if at the
end of your linked list.

To check if a diretory exists we are checking our current working
folder. The way we do that is go through all our files till we find
the occurence of it. The one issue we have we this is it will only
find the first occurence so if multiple folders exist with the same
name things are going to be a bit haywire.

I have tried a way around which is to take the index of the last value we 
cd'd into and then going up to find it's . and down but this will only
fix non cd issues.

IMPORTANT - We need to read the file contents of the directory that is our active directory. So need to add some function for that
probably in change directory.


to check to see if it is ok to cd into a directory, check the folder you want to go into's ".." name attribute and see if it is the current folder.
