directory contains clusters and clusters contains records

file allocation table - implements linked list. Starting with a cluster and want to
get to next cluster. To get to the next one take current cluster, index into file allocation table
it will give you the next cluster number. Checking if their is or isnt a next cluster or if at the
end of your linked list.

IMPORTANT - We need to read the file contents of the directory that is our active directory. So need to add some function for that
probably in change directory.
