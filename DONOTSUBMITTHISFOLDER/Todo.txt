Known bugs

Can cd or ls to a directory which is not the child of the current. See MiscNotes.txt
. and .. not being parsed corectly may have to do with the ls and cd stuff. Partly

Cant rm or rmdir anything in main directory. Need to check if directory is empty
before removing directory. Also printing out directories in root directory.

ls .. doesn't work it causes a crash
