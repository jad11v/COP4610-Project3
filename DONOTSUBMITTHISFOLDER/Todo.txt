Known bugs

Can cd or ls to a directory which is not the child of the current. See MiscNotes.txt
. and .. not being parsed corectly may have to do with the ls and cd stuff. Partly
implemented.

Cant rm or rmdir anything in main directory. Need to check if directory is empty
before removing directory. Also printing out directories in root directory.

ls .. doesn't work it causes a crash

MUST BE DONE

Finish Report
remove couts that should be marked as debug or add if(DEBUG) to only print out

Fixed

Cant cd without doing ls first. We need to just abstract the ls code a bit more.
And then intergrate that with cd. At the moment cd only checks if the directory
exists and doesn't do much else.
